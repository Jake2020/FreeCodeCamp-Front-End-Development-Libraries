# Jake's FreeCodeCamp-Front-End-Development-Libraries Projects
A repository to host my FreeCodeCamp 'Front End Development Libraries' projects and Certification.

Each project has been hosted on GitHub Pages as a simple responsive webpage made up of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, so the user can test and interact with the code.

GitHub Pages Link (for my reference): https://jake2020.github.io/FreeCodeCamp-Front-End-Development-Libraries/

## The following projects/coding challenges were completed to gain this certification:

1. [Random Quote Generator](https://jake2020.github.io/FreeCodeCamp-Front-End-Development-Libraries/RandomQuoteMachine.html)
2. [Markdown Previewer](https://jake2020.github.io/FreeCodeCamp-Front-End-Development-Libraries/MarkdownPreviewer.html)
3. Coming Soon
4. Coming Soon
5. Coming Soon

## Project 1: [Random Quote Generator](https://jake2020.github.io/FreeCodeCamp-Front-End-Development-Libraries/RandomQuoteMachine.html)
A simple web page that generates a random quote upon each refresh or click of the "New Quote" button. Also includes functionality to tweet the displayed quote and change page background colour with each new quote.

*Note: There's only 5 quotes and 5 background colours, so it's possible for either the background, the quote, or neither, to appear to have changed due to the same quote/colour/both being selected again.*

Objective:

Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://random-quote-machine.freecodecamp.rocks/.

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

You can use any mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Redux, and jQuery to complete this project. You should use a frontend framework (like React for example) because this section is about learning frontend frameworks. Additional technologies not listed above are not recommended and using them is at your own risk. We are looking at supporting other frontend frameworks like Angular and Vue, but they are not currently supported. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!

Requirements:

- User Story #1: I can see a wrapper element with a corresponding id="quote-box".

- User Story #2: Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="text".

- User Story #3: Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="author".

- User Story #4: Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding id="new-quote".

- User Story #5: Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable a element with a corresponding id="tweet-quote".

- User Story #6: On first load, my quote machine displays a random quote in the element with id="text".

- User Story #7: On first load, my quote machine displays the random quote's author in the element with id="author".

- User Story #8: When the #new-quote button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display it in the #text element.

- User Story #9: My quote machine should fetch the new quote's author when the #new-quote button is clicked and display it in the #author element.

- User Story #10: I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the #tweet-quote a element. This a element should include the "twitter.com/intent/tweet" path in its href attribute to tweet the current quote.

- User Story #11: The #quote-box wrapper element should be horizontally centered. Please run tests with browser's zoom level at 100% and page maximized.

## Project 2: [Markdown Previewer](https://jake2020.github.io/FreeCodeCamp-Front-End-Development-Libraries/MarkdownPreviewer.html)

A simple web page that allows the user to input markdown and preview what their markdown will look like once parsed into HTML.

Objective:

Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://markdown-previewer.freecodecamp.rocks/.

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

You can use any mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Redux, and jQuery to complete this project. You should use a frontend framework (like React for example) because this section is about learning frontend frameworks.

We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!

Requirements:

User Story #1: I can see a textarea element with a corresponding id="editor".

User Story #2: I can see an element with a corresponding id="preview".

User Story #3: When I enter text into the #editor element, the #preview element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.

User Story #4: When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the #editor element, the text is rendered as HTML in the #preview element as I type (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).

User Story #5: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a heading element (H1 size), a sub heading element (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.

User Story #6: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editor field should be rendered as HTML in the #preview element.

Optional Bonus (you do not need to make this test pass): My markdown previewer interprets carriage returns and renders them as br (line break) elements.
