## Project 1: [Random Quote Generator](https://jake2020.github.io/FreeCodeCamp-Front-End-Development-Libraries/RandomQuoteMachine.html)
A simple web page to demonstrates using HTML, CSS, and JavScript to generates a random quote upon each refresh or click of the "New Quote" button. Also includes functionality to tweet the displayed quote and change page background colour with each new quote.

*Note: There's only 5 quotes and 5 background colours, so it's possible for either the background, the quote, or neither, to appear to have changed due to the same quote/colour/both being selected again.*

Requirements:

- User Story #1: I can see a wrapper element with a corresponding id="quote-box".

- User Story #2: Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="text".

- User Story #3: Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="author".

- User Story #4: Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding id="new-quote".

- User Story #5: Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable a element with a corresponding id="tweet-quote".

- User Story #6: On first load, my quote machine displays a random quote in the element with id="text".

- User Story #7: On first load, my quote machine displays the random quote's author in the element with id="author".

- User Story #8: When the #new-quote button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display it in the #text element.

- User Story #9: My quote machine should fetch the new quote's author when the #new-quote button is clicked and display it in the #author element.

- User Story #10: I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the #tweet-quote a element. This a element should include the "twitter.com/intent/tweet" path in its href attribute to tweet the current quote.

- User Story #11: The #quote-box wrapper element should be horizontally centered. Please run tests with browser's zoom level at 100% and page maximized.
